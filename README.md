# Composer-enabled Wordpress Upstream template

This is Pantheon's recommended starting point for forking new upstreams that work with the Platform's integrated
Composer build process. Replace this with a description of your site. See `upstream-config/README.md` for advice
on customizing this upstream and instructions on how to use it to create individual sites.

For more information and detailed installation guides, please visit the Integrated Composer Pantheon documentation: https://pantheon.io/docs/integrated-composer
